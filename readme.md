## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Welcome to the official documentation for my Reddit clone project! This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), with the aim of creating a functional and user-friendly platform for sharing and discussing content on a variety of topics.

The Reddit clone provides many features that are similar to the original Reddit website, including subreddits, posts, and comments. Users can create and join different subreddits, create posts within those subreddits, and engage in discussions with other users through comments. In addition, users can subscribe to their favorite subreddits to stay up-to-date with the latest content.

The project was created as a way to demonstrate my skills in web development and to learn more about the MERN stack. As a passionate user of the Reddit platform, I wanted to create a clone that had similar functionality while also adding some of my own features and ideas.

In the following documentation, you will find detailed information about how to install and set up the application, as well as explanations of the main components and features. I hope this documentation will be useful for anyone who wants to learn more about the project, contribute to its development, or create their own Reddit clone. Thank you for checking out my project, and happy browsing!

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

While you can use the website without having an account it is recommended that you create one so you can have the ability to create subreddits, posts and comments.

To use this Reddit clone, you will need to start by creating an account on the Register page. Here you will need to provide your email, password, and username. Once you have created your account, you can log in using your email and password on the Login page.

After logging in, you will be directed to the All Posts page, where you can view all posts from all subreddits. If you want to see posts from only the subreddits you have subscribed to, you can navigate to the Subscribed page.

To explore different subreddits, go to the Subreddits page. Here, you will find a list of all subreddits available on the site. Clicking on a subreddit will take you to that subreddit's page, where you can view posts related only to that subreddit. You can also create your own subreddit from this page.

To publish your own post, navigate to the Publish Post page. Here, you can create and submit your post to the site.

Finally, if you want to view the details of a specific post, you can visit the Post page. This page will showcase the post along with its comments, author, and date of publication.
